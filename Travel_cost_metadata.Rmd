## 4. Car (price per trip)
- base mileage rate calculated from AAA national gas price as of March 2019 (https://gasprices.aaa.com/state-gas-price-averages) : **$2.45/gallon**
- average efficiency of a standard passenger car calculated from 2016 data (https://www.bts.gov/content/average-fuel-efficiency-us-light-duty-vehicles): **22 mpg** 
- distance calculated from UCSB (Goleta, CA) to the National Park using google maps
- TOTAL AUTO TRAVEL COST FORMULA:
$$ Cost = 2 * (distance(miles)/22mpg) *2.45/gallon $$

### Auto Distances and Round Trip Costs:
- SB--> Arches: 819 miles (**cost = 2 x (819/22 x 2.45) == $182.41 **)
- SB--> Badlands: 1,429 (**cost  = $318.28**)
- SB--> Channel Islands: 46 miles (**cost = $10.25**)
- SB--> Glacier: 1,436 (**cost = $319.84**)
- SB--> Grand Teton: 1,044 (**cost = 232.53 **)
- SB--> Redwood: 638 (**cost = $142.10**)
- SB--> Shenandoah: 2,692 (**cost = $599.58**)
- SB--> Yellowstone: 1,119 (**cost = $249.23**)
- SB--> Yosemite: 363 (**cost = 80.85**)
- SB--> Zion: 526 (**cost = 117.15**)



## 5. Plane (price per round-trip flight, plus extra)

## Calculation 1: round-trip flight to nearest airport
- total price is for one person 
- ** note: to make the data compilation easier, flights are from LAX to nearest major airport ** (driving from NMA to the national park might be longer) 
- historic seasonal price for 2018-2019 data obtained from (https://faredetective.com)
- base prices chosen from a mid-month weekday (12-16) and for a 4 day trip


### Plane Roundtrip costs:

#### 1. Arches: LAX--> LAS (McCarran)
- Jan: 
- Feb: 
- Mar
- Apr
- May
- June
- July
- Aug
- Sep: 
- Oct: $722
- Nov: $571
- Dec: $441


### 2. LAX--> RAP Badlands

### 3. SB--> Channel Islands: NO AIRPORT*, NO FLIGHTS
*Santa Rosa Island has a landing strip, but to avoid further complication and confusion it is assumed that the only way to make it to CINP is by boat

### 4. LAX--> FCA Glacier CALGARY?!
- no data on fare detective


### 5. LAX--> IDA (Idaho Falls) Grand Teton:

### 6. LAX--> SFO/SAC (closest with data) Redwood: 

### 7. LAX--> IAD Shenandoah

### 8. SB--> Yellowstone BZN (closest with data)

### 9. SB--> FAT Yosemite: 

### 10. SB--> LAS Zion


### Calculation 2: additional travel cost via car/bus/whatever to NP 


### Plane Flight Formula:
where p is the number of people traveling:

$$ PlaneCost = x(TicketPrice) + (CarPrice) $$

## 6. Additional Fees?

- for Channel Islands: need to include roundtrip boat price 

### Channel Islands: Overnight Boat Price (two adults):
- Anacapa: 79*2 = $158
- San Miguel: 147 * 2 = $294
- Santa Barbara: XX (closed for 2019)
- Santa Cruz: 79 *2 = $158
- Santa Rosa: 114 * 2 = $228

**average price for boating (from four islands) is = $209.50 **




## Travel Cost Formula

where x is the number of days staying at the NP, 

$$TRAVEL COST = (Park Entrance) + [CampFee*x]||[HotelPrice*x] + [CarRound]||[PlaneRound] + AddnlFee$$
