```{r load_clean_year_data}

yellowstone_vis_year <- read_csv("~/github/BowenShinyApp/Visitation_data/yellowstone_vis_year.csv")

#The yearly data as it stands goes from very small to very large
#Let's maybe mutate it to have a column of millions of visitors?

yellowstone_vis_year <- yellowstone_vis_year %>% 
  mutate(Visitors_Mil = RecreationVisitors/1000000)

```

```{r plot_year}

ggplot(yellowstone_vis_year, 
       aes(x=Year, y=Visitors_Mil))+
  geom_point() +
